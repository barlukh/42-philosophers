# 42 - Philosophers

## About
Philosophers is a project from the 42-cursus curriculum. It explores the challenges of concurrent programming by simulating the classic Dining Philosophers Problem, where multiple philosophers sit at a table and alternate between thinking, eating, and sleepingâ€”while competing for limited shared resources (forks). The goal is to implement a system that prevents deadlocks, race conditions, and starvation, ensuring that all philosophers can eat without conflict.

This repository is mostly just an archive of my studies, and can serve as a reference for future students in a time of need. However, I strongly encourage students to avoid just copy-pasting.
